# DevSkim

DevSkim is a framework of IDE plugins and Language analyzers that provide inline security analysis in the dev environment as the developer writes code. It is designed to work with multiple IDEs (VS, VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), and has a flexible rule model that supports multiple programming languages. The idea is to give the developer notification as they are introducing a security vulnerability in order to fix the issue at the point of introduction, and to help build awareness for the developer.

### Repositories

DevSkim consists of multiple repositories (one for the rules, and one per plugin):

* [DevSkim-Rules](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim-Rules/) - Common Rules
* [DevSkim-VisualStudio](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim-VisualStudio-Plugin/) - Visual Studio Plugin
* [DevSkim-SublimeText](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim-Sublime-Plugin/) - Sublime Text Plugin
* [DevSkim-VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/DevSkim-VSCode-Plugin/) - VSCode Plugin

Please access those projects to download the plugin, open issues, or contribute content.
